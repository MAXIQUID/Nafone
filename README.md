# NAFON

NAFON (No-Phone / Phone Within a Phone) is a revolutionary mobile phone concept that redefines the form and function of personal devices. Inspired by classic numeric keypad phones, NAFON blends modern touch-screen design with retro ergonomics.

## Key Features

- Central loudspeaker integrated into aluminum frame
- Classic numeric keypad etched into rear glass
- iPhone-style front screen with no notch
- Side screens replacing bezels for utility display
- Top and bottom screens for multi-orientation UI
- Rear-facing speaker grill in place of a traditional camera

## Directives

This project is currently experimental. All files in this repo serve as design documentation and creative R&D.

## Potentials

- CAD modeling for chassis & acoustic chamber design
- E-ink or AMOLED embedded keypad
- Side bezel micro-displays for AI notification feed
- Codebase for OS shell or prototype firmware UI

## Next Steps

- [ ] Add `hardware/` folder with loudspeaker specifications
- [ ] Add `software/` folder with UI prototype ideas
- [ ] Render visual mockups in `assets/sketches`
- [ ] Begin CAD modeling in `cad/` folder
